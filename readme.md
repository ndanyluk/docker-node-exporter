**ndanyluk/docker-node-exporter |** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ndanyluk/docker-node-exporter-amd64.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ndanyluk/docker-node-exporter-amd64)

This repository is my home for docker images based on prometheus.io's Node Exporter software.  This repo packages the binary file with a configuration folder found in stefanprodan's swarmprom repo and creates an amd64 based image.

I plan to merge this repository with my other node exporter repositories at a later date to produce a multi-arch docker image of node exporter for use on both embedded ARM controllers (RPi) and x86 PCs
